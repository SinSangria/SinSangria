	  Sin enjoys Art and Tech. Sin can often be seen creating digital art, coding, or learning something new. And has plans to learn: Animation, Guitar, Singing, and Tech topics. See Sin stuggle at all of the above live on <a href="https://m.twitch.tv/sinsangria/home">Twitch</a>! Weekly streams at 8pm EST on Tuesdays and Sundays!

	  <h3>Lore</h3>
          <p>A lowborn demon is born in a world where the more of a name one makes of their-self, the more powerful of a demon they are. Everyone knows of Lucifer, but even lesser known demons with recognizable names are still mighty demons. 

<br><br>Born from nameless lowborns, another nameless demon appears. They have long since grown weary of the demons around. Preferring to spend time alone creating art and becoming fascinated with a world beyond, the world of the internet where mortals and non-mortals alike interact and discuss common interests. 

<br><br>While they longed to join the world of the internet, how could a nameless demon possibly hope to do so without a name or value? And so, determined to make their dream come true one day, they worked to improve their art over the years until they felt it was worthy enough to obtain a name, even if it did not yet hold the power of a greater demon’s name. 

<br><br>Once the time had come, they performed a ritual offering up their hopes, dreams, blood, and skills into a name. Then they reached into a pool of their own blood and pulled out a wine glass with wings. On the inside of the glass was written “SinSangria”. 

<br><br>Having achieved the first step in SinSangria’s journey, Sin smirked and excitedly started preparing to become a menace on the internet. Sin could not wait to partake in and inspire creative indulgence with others of similar taste - with those unafraid to defy societal norms and embrace their darkest impulses in the name of their craft.

<p><b>Name:</b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Soul (SoulAmi/<s>SoulDevourer</s>)<br>
            <b>Pronouns:</b> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp All of them<br>
            <b>Age:</b> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Eternal<br>

	  <h3>Lore</h3>
          <p>
		  SoulDevourer was once a creature feared by all. A shapeless black void with piercing eyes, Soul was a creature from the nightmare realm. Roaming between worlds, Soul would ask anyone they came across a simple question: “What is it I seek?”

<br><br>Upon failure to answer or given the incorrect answer, your soul would be absorbed from your body, leaving a trail of soulless bodies. “If you cannot tell me, then your soul is what I shall seek”.

<br><br>SoulDevourer had given up on finding an answer and was approaching the next meal. A young demon with clouded eyes looked up at Soul’s approach. Soul got ready to take this demon’s soul but still asked out of habit “What is it I seek?”

<br><br>Surprisingly, the demon who had yet to show signs of fear and instead appeared reluctantly curious, answered in a small child-like voice “Friendship?”

<br><br>This… This was the answer Soul had been searching for. 

<br><br>Soul took a look at the child, and really looked. No longer seeing a meal but instead a potential friend. 

<br><br>The young demon spoke up again, this time with gleaming eyes, “You’re cute and if you’re looking for a friend, how about becoming my familiar? That way we can be together forever!”

<br><br>Astounded at being called “cute” Soul was about to tell the demon that cute was not a fitting description when Soul stopped and realized that being called cute wasn’t so bad. Soul wouldn't mind being called cute again. Having come to a decision, Soul formed a contract to become this demon’s familiar and decided to take a new name “SoulAmi” and a new form, one that would appeal to the young demon’s taste and to Soul’s newfound purpose, friendship.
